# 本分支是 SRtool 的开发分支 与Difficult Rocket基本无关

- 因为窗口框架、整体结构、API接口跟DR相同，所以作为Difficult Rocket的分支存在
- 以后DR的API和库更新也会更新到这里
- 另外，这里的很多函数就直接中文编程了
- 另外的话，这个分支就不会怎么对英文做支持了(lazy)
- pyglet的库还是会照常更新的

## Required python modules

- `json5` (pre-installed V0.9.6 path:`./libs/json5`)
- `pyglet` (pre-installed V2.0.dev11 path:`./libs/pyglet`)
- `pillow`
- `semver`
